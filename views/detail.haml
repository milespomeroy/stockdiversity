  %h2 Description:
  %p 
    Stock carries a deletion in the cv and the CG3160 (lipase) genes. The deletion 
    was induced by mobilizing the P-element in the EP1349 line. 50% lethality due 
    to second site mutation; crossveins are missing, slight delta-like effect in 
    the LVs. The region surrounding the deletion was sequenced.

      By reason of these things, then, the whaling voyage was welcome; the 
      great flood-gates of the wonder-world swung open, and in the wild 
      conceits that swayed me to my purpose, two and two there floated into 
      my inmost soul, endless processions of the whale, and, mid most of them 
      all, one grand hooded phantom, like a snow hill in the air.
